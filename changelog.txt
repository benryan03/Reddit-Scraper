v1.0 (2/13/20)
First working version.
Several bugs need to be fixed:
	Test for all combinations of cases where Reddit links are direct/indirect images, and include/do not include extensions
	Add user inputs to specify scraping parameters
	Add additional details to names of downloaded images
	
v1.1 (2/15/20)
User can now specify subreddit to parse
User can not specify the number of submissions to parse
Program will now detect whether a submission is a direct image link, and if not, it will print an error and move to the next submission
