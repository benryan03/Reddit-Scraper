v1.0 (2/13/20)
First working version.
Several bugs need to be fixed:
Need to test for all combinations of cases where Reddit links are direct/indirect images, and include/do not include extensions
Need to add user inputs to specify scraping parameters
Need to add additional details to names of downloaded images
	
v1.1 (2/15/20)
User can now specify subreddit to parse
User can not specify the number of submissions to parse
Program will now detect whether a submission is a direct image link, and if not, it will print an error and move to the next submission

v1.2 (2/15/20)
Program will now detect whether an image already exists in the download directory, and if so, will skip it
This introduces a bug: if an image has the same title as a previously downloaded image, it will be skipped
Need to add submission timestamp to names of downloaded files to differentiate these cases

v1.3 (2/16/20)
Program will add a datetime stamp to the beginning of the file name of downloaded images

v1.4 (2/16/20)
Fixed a bug where program would crash if a Reddit submission title included a character that cannot be used in file names
If such a character is detected, progran will now change it to that character's HTML number in the file name

v1.5 (2/17/20)
Added user input to sort selected subreddit by new, hot, or top

v1.6 (2/17/20)
Moved datetime function to inline code to improve readability
Added comments to improve readability
Removed an old debug message
